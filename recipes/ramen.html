    <p>If you're an anime lover such as myself, you probably enjoy some good ole fashion ramen.<br>
    This recipe may not be the same quality as your favorite anime noodle shop, Ramen Ichiraku, <br>
    but it's pretty close.</p>
    <p>Let's start with the ingredients.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <uL>
            <li>2 boneless chicken breasts (skin on)</li>
            <li>Kosher Salt and freshly-ground pepper to season</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 tsp fresh ginger, minced</li>
            <li>1 Tbps fresh garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li> 1 oz dried shitake mushrooms</li>
            <li>1-2 tsp sea salt, to taste</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup scallions, sliced</li>
            <li>2 (3 oz) packs dried ramen noodles</li>
        </uL>
    <h4>Time to Cook</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the chicken*: Preheat the oven to 375℉. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down,<br>
                and cook until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip<br>
                the chicken over and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.<br>
                Remove from the oven, transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with foil until ready to serve.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Make the ramen broth: Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat, until shimmering. Add the garlic <br> 
                and ginger, and cook for a few minutes until softened. Add the soy sauce and mirin, and stir to <br> 
                combine. Cook for another minute.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add the stock, cover, and bring to boil. Remove the lid, and let simmer uncovered for 5 minutes,<br>
                then add the dried mushrooms. Simmer gently for another 10 minutes, and season with salt, to taste.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Make the soft-boiled eggs: Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs, and bring to a boil. <br> 
                Gently lower the eggs (still cold from the fridge) into the boiling water, and let simmer for 7 <br>
                minutes (for a slightly-runny yoke) or 8 minutes (for a soft, but set-up yoke).</li>
            <br>
            <li>Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes, transfer the eggs to the ice <br>
                bath to stop the cooking process. Wait at least 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle, then <br>
                carefully peel away the shell and slice in half, lengthwise. Set aside until ready to serve.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Assemble the ramen bowls: Meanwhile, chop the scallions and jalapeño (if using). Slice the chicken <br> 
                into thin pieces. Set aside. When the eggs finish cooking, add the ramen noodles to the boiling water.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two large bowls. Add the sliced chicken <br> 
                and the ramen broth. Top with the fresh scallions, jalapeño and the soft boiled egg. Serve immediately.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Enjoy :)</li>

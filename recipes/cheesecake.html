    <p>I know what you're thinking.  What exactly is Japanese cheesecake?  We'll, it's <br>
        similar to regular cheesecake, but this has a cotton-like fluffy texture that was <br>
        made famous in Japan.  Now, less chatting.  More baking!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <uL>
            <li>5 large eggs, room temperature/li>
            <li>1/4 tsp cream of tarter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar, divided</li>
            <li>8 oz cream cheese, room temperature</li>
            <li>1/2 cup low-fat milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp corn starch</li>
            <li> 8 inch round springform pan</li>
        </uL>
    <h4>Time to Cook</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Line the bottom and side of the springform pan with parchment paper. Wrap <br>
                the springform pan with several sheets of foil, sealing it completely.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Fill a large baking pan halfway with water. Place it in the oven on the lowest<br>
                rack. Preheat the oven to 315 F (157 C).</li>
            <br>
            <li>Separate the eggs and place the egg whites into a mixing bowl and the yolks <br> 
                into a measuring cup.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Beat the egg whites on Low speed for 30 seconds. Increase the speed to Medium <br> 
                Low and beat for another 30 seconds or until foamy. Add the cream of tartar. <br>
                Increase the speed to Medium High and beat until the egg whites just start to <br>
                thicken. Add 1/4 cup sugar gradually. Continue beating until the egg whites reach <br>
                the soft peaks stage (approximately 3 minutes using a stand mixer).</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a separate bowl, add the cream cheese and milk. Mix on Low speed until creamy <br> 
                and smooth (approximately 2-3 minutes). Add the butter, remaining 1/4 cup sugar <br> 
                and lemon juice and beat for 1 minute. Add the flour and corn starch and mix for <br> 
                another minute. Finally add the egg yolks and mix for 1 more minute. Strain the <br>
                batter using a sieve.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add 1/3 of the egg whites and gently fold into the batter until mostly incorporated.<br> 
                Add another 1/3 and gently fold. Add the remaining 1/3 and gently fold.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Pour the batter into the lined springform pan. Spread the batter evenly into the <br> 
                pan and smooth out the top using a spatula. Holding the side of the pan, gently lift <br>
                and drop the pan on the counter about 6 times to remove any big air bubbles.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Place the springform pan into the water bath and bake the cake for 1 hour and 10 <br>
                minutes. Check the cake for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center of the <br> 
                cake. (It should come out clean.) Bake the cake for an additional 10-15 minutes to <br> 
                brown the top.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Turn off the oven, open the oven door slightly (about 2-3 inches) and let the cheesecake <br>
                cool in the oven for 1 hour.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Remove the Cotton Cheesecake from the pan. Place on a plate and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Top with fresh fruit, fruit puree, chocolate sauce, whipped cream, etc.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cut a slice (or two) turn on your favorite slice of life anime, kick up your feet, <br>
            and enjoy :)</li>
